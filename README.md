# code-quiz

The application has a few multiple-choice questions and stores scores on the user's device. Once the user clicks "Start," they are penalized 15 seconds to answer a question incorrectly. The final score is based on the amount remaining on the timer.
At the end of the quiz (when the user answers all questions or the time is up), the user can enter their initials to add their score to the Scores list upon viewing their score. Once they enter their initials, the scoreboard will appear with an option to clear the board or back to the landing page.
